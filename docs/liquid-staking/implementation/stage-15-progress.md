# Stage 15 Progress Report: Auto-compound & Rewards

## Overview
Stage 15 implementation is in progress. This stage adds automatic reward compounding and exchange rate updates to the liquid staking module.

## Completed Components

### 1. Auto-compound Infrastructure (✓)
**File**: `x/liquidstaking/keeper/auto_compound.go`
- Implemented `BeginBlocker` hook for automatic execution
- Created `AutoCompoundAllValidators` to process all validators
- Implemented `CompoundValidatorRewards` for individual validator compounding
- Added frequency control with `shouldCompoundInBlock`
- Implemented last compound height tracking

### 2. Safety Mechanisms (✓)
**File**: `x/liquidstaking/keeper/auto_compound.go`
- `ApplyRateLimits`: Caps exchange rate changes to prevent manipulation
- `CanUpdateExchangeRate`: Enforces minimum blocks between updates
- `ValidateAutoCompoundParams`: Validates parameter constraints
- Error handling that logs but doesn't halt the chain

### 3. Module Integration (✓)
**File**: `x/liquidstaking/module.go`
- Added `BeginBlock` method to AppModule
- Integrated with keeper's BeginBlocker

### 4. Event Types (✓)
**File**: `x/liquidstaking/types/events.go`
- Added auto-compound event types:
  - `EventTypeRewardsCompounded`
  - `EventTypeAutoCompoundStarted`
  - `EventTypeAutoCompoundCompleted`
  - `EventTypeAutoCompoundFailed`
- Added corresponding attribute keys

### 5. Storage Keys (✓)
**File**: `x/liquidstaking/types/keys.go`
- Added `LastAutoCompoundHeightKey` for tracking execution

### 6. Parameter Updates (✓)
**File**: `proto/flora/liquidstaking/v1/types.proto`
- Added auto-compound parameters to ModuleParams:
  ```proto
  bool auto_compound_enabled = 12;
  int64 auto_compound_frequency_blocks = 13;
  string max_rate_change_per_update = 14;
  int64 min_blocks_between_updates = 15;
  ```

### 7. Default Parameters (✓)
**File**: `x/liquidstaking/types/types.go`
- Updated `DefaultParams()` with auto-compound defaults:
  - Disabled by default
  - 28800 blocks frequency (~24 hours)
  - 1% max rate change per update
  - 100 blocks minimum between updates

### 8. Parameter Validation (✓)
**File**: `x/liquidstaking/types/types.go`
- Extended `Validate()` to check auto-compound parameters
- Updated `NewParams()` to include auto-compound fields

### 9. Test Coverage (✓)
**File**: `x/liquidstaking/keeper/auto_compound_test.go`
- Tests for auto-compound frequency control
- Tests for parameter validation
- Tests for rate limiting
- Tests for update eligibility checks
- Tests for compound rewards functionality

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Non-blocking Execution**: Auto-compound errors are logged but don't halt the chain
2. **Rate Limiting**: Exchange rate changes are capped to prevent manipulation
3. **Frequency Control**: Configurable block-based frequency for auto-compound execution
4. **Modular Design**: Clean separation between auto-compound logic and core functionality

## Implementation Details

### Auto-compound Flow
1. `BeginBlock` checks if auto-compound is enabled
2. Verifies enough blocks have passed since last execution
3. Iterates through all validators with LST tokens
4. For each validator:
   - Calculates accumulated rewards
   - Withdraws rewards to module account
   - Re-delegates rewards to the validator
   - Updates exchange rate with safety limits
5. Emits events for tracking and indexing

### Safety Features
- Maximum rate change per update (default 1%)
- Minimum blocks between updates (default 100)
- Configurable frequency (default 24 hours)
- Non-critical errors don't halt chain

## Pending Tasks

### 1. Protobuf Generation
The protobuf code needs to be regenerated to include the new auto-compound fields:
```bash
make proto-gen
```

### 2. Distribution Integration
The current implementation has a simplified reward withdrawal mechanism. Full integration requires:
- Proper reward withdrawal from distribution module
- Handling of commission vs delegation rewards
- Integration with distribution hooks

### 3. IBC Integration
Consider how auto-compound affects IBC transfers of LST tokens:
- Rate synchronization across chains
- Handling of in-flight transfers during rate updates

### 4. Additional Testing
After protobuf generation:
- Integration tests with full node setup
- Performance testing with many validators
- Edge case testing (no rewards, failed delegations, etc.)

## Usage

### Enable Auto-compound (Governance)
```bash
# Submit governance proposal to enable auto-compound
florad tx gov submit-proposal update-params liquidstaking \
  --auto-compound-enabled=true \
  --auto-compound-frequency-blocks=28800 \
  --from authority
```

### Query Auto-compound Status
```bash
# Check module parameters
florad query liquidstaking params

# Check last auto-compound height
florad query liquidstaking last-auto-compound-height
```

## Migration Notes

No migration required as auto-compound is disabled by default. Can be enabled via governance after deployment.

## Next Steps

1. Generate protobuf code when Docker is available
2. Run comprehensive test suite
3. Implement distribution module integration
4. Create documentation for node operators
5. Add monitoring metrics for auto-compound performance

## Conclusion

Stage 15 implementation is largely complete with all core functionality in place. The auto-compound system is designed to be safe, configurable, and non-disruptive to chain operation. Once protobuf generation is complete and tests pass, the feature will be ready for deployment.
