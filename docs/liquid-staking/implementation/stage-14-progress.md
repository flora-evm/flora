# Stage 14: Exchange Rate Updates - Progress Report

## Overview
Stage 14 implements dynamic exchange rates for LST tokens, allowing them to appreciate in value as staking rewards accumulate.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Protobuf Definitions ✅
Added new message types to support exchange rates:
- `ExchangeRate`: Stores rate for each validator's LST token
- `GlobalExchangeRate`: Tracks overall exchange rate statistics
- `MsgUpdateExchangeRates`: Message for manual rate updates
- `ExchangeRateUpdate`: Response type for rate updates
- Query messages for retrieving exchange rates

### 2. Storage Implementation ✅
Created comprehensive exchange rate storage and calculation system:
- **File**: `x/liquidstaking/keeper/exchange_rate.go`
- **Key Functions**:
  - `SetExchangeRate/GetExchangeRate`: Store and retrieve rates
  - `GetOrInitExchangeRate`: Initialize with 1:1 rate if not exists
  - `CalculateExchangeRate`: Calculate rate based on validator state and rewards
  - `UpdateExchangeRate`: Update rate for specific validator
  - `UpdateAllExchangeRates`: Update rates for all validators
  - `ApplyExchangeRate/ApplyInverseExchangeRate`: Convert between native and LST tokens

### 3. Keeper Updates ✅
- Added `DistributionKeeper` interface for accessing validator rewards
- Updated keeper constructor to accept distribution keeper
- Updated app.go to pass distribution keeper to liquid staking module
- Added required methods to expected keeper interfaces

### 4. Event System ✅
Added exchange rate events:
- `EventTypeExchangeRateUpdated`: Emitted when rates change
- Attributes: validator, old_rate, new_rate, timestamp

## Exchange Rate Formula

```
Exchange Rate = (Total Staked + Total Rewards) / Total LST Supply
```

Where:
- Total Staked = Validator's total delegated tokens
- Total Rewards = Accumulated rewards for the validator
- Total LST Supply = Total minted LST tokens for that validator

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Update Tokenization Logic
- Modify `TokenizeDelegation` to use current exchange rate
- Calculate LST amount based on: `LST = Native Amount / Exchange Rate`
- Ensure proper precision handling

### 2. Update Redemption Logic
- Modify `RedeemTokens` to use current exchange rate
- Calculate native amount based on: `Native = LST Amount * Exchange Rate`
- Handle partial redemptions with exchange rates

### 3. Implement Manual Update Message
- Complete `MsgUpdateExchangeRates` handler
- Add authorization checks (governance or designated updater)
- Batch update support for multiple validators

### 4. Implement Queries
- `ExchangeRate`: Get rate for specific validator
- `AllExchangeRates`: Get all rates with pagination
- Include global statistics in response

### 5. Testing
- Unit tests for rate calculations
- Integration tests for tokenization/redemption with rates
- Precision tests with large numbers
- Edge cases (zero supply, first mint, slashing)

## Technical Decisions

1. **Initial Rate**: All validators start with 1:1 exchange rate
2. **Rate Storage**: Stored per validator with timestamp
3. **Precision**: Using `math.LegacyDec` for calculations
4. **Updates**: Manual in Stage 14, automated in Stage 15

## Next Steps

With storage and calculation logic complete, the next priority is:
1. Update tokenization to use exchange rates
2. Update redemption to use exchange rates
3. Implement message handlers and queries
4. Comprehensive testing

This sets the foundation for Stage 15's auto-compounding feature.
