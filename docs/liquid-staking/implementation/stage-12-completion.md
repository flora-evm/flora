# Stage 12: Events & Hooks - Completion Report

## Overview
Stage 12 has been successfully completed. The liquid staking module now has a comprehensive event system and hooks interface that allows external modules to integrate with liquid staking operations. This provides extensive monitoring capabilities and enables complex cross-module interactions.

- **Test Coverage**:
  - Hook registration and panic on double-set
  - Multi-hooks execution order
  - Error propagation in pre-hooks
  - Event emission verification
  - Event attribute validation
  - Hook integration with rate limits

#### 6. Module Integration (✅ Complete)
- **File**: `module.go`
- Added `SetHooks` method to AppModule
- Allows external modules to register hooks during app initialization

## Event Types Summary

### Core Operation Events
1. **TokenizeShares**: Emitted when shares are tokenized
2. **RedeemTokens**: Emitted when tokens are redeemed
3. **UpdateParams**: Emitted when module parameters change

### Record Lifecycle Events
1. **TokenizationRecordCreated**: New record created
2. **TokenizationRecordUpdated**: Record amount changed
3. **TokenizationRecordDeleted**: Record fully redeemed

### Rate Limiting Events
1. **RateLimitExceeded**: Rate limit hit, operation rejected
2. **RateLimitWarning**: Approaching rate limit threshold
3. **ActivityTracked**: Activity successfully recorded

### Cap Events
1. **LiquidStakingCap**: Approaching or exceeding caps

## Hook Integration Points

### Pre-Operation Hooks (Can Reject)
- `PreTokenizeShares`: Validate tokenization request
- `PreRedeemTokens`: Validate redemption request

### Post-Operation Hooks (Notification Only)
- `PostTokenizeShares`: React to successful tokenization
- `PostRedeemTokens`: React to successful redemption

### State Change Hooks
- Record creation/update/deletion
- Rate limit exceeded
- Cap limits reached

## Usage Example

```go
// In app.go, after module creation:
liquidStakingModule := liquidstaking.NewAppModule(liquidStakingKeeper)

// Create custom hooks implementation
customHooks := NewCustomLiquidStakingHooks(/* dependencies */)

// Set hooks
liquidStakingModule.SetHooks(customHooks)

// Or use multi-hooks for multiple integrations
multiHooks := types.NewMultiLiquidStakingHooks(
    customHooks1,
    customHooks2,
    customHooks3,
)
liquidStakingModule.SetHooks(multiHooks)
```

## Technical Decisions

1. **Typed Events**: Used typed structs with ToEvent() for type safety
2. **Hook Error Handling**: Pre-hooks can reject operations, post-hooks cannot
3. **Multi-Hook Pattern**: Allows multiple modules to integrate simultaneously
4. **No-Op Default**: Safe default when no hooks are set
5. **Event Granularity**: Rich attributes for detailed monitoring

## Performance Characteristics

- **Event Emission**: O(1) per event
- **Hook Calls**: O(n) where n is number of registered hooks
- **Memory**: Minimal overhead, events are fire-and-forget
- **Error Propagation**: Fast-fail on first pre-hook error

## Integration Guidelines

### For Module Developers
1. Implement only the hooks you need
2. Pre-hooks should validate quickly and fail fast
3. Post-hooks should not perform heavy operations
4. Use events for async processing needs

### For Chain Operators
1. Monitor rate limit events for usage patterns
2. Set up alerts on warning events
3. Track activity events for analytics
4. Use cap events for governance decisions

## Testing Results

### Unit Tests
- ✅ Hook registration and retrieval
- ✅ Panic on double registration
- ✅ Multi-hook execution order
- ✅ Pre-hook error propagation
- ✅ Event emission on rate limits
- ✅ Event attribute validation
- ✅ Activity tracking events
- ✅ Hook-event integration

### Integration Points
- ✅ TokenizeShares hook integration
- ✅ RedeemTokens hook integration
- ✅ Rate limiter hook calls
- ✅ Record lifecycle hooks

## Known Limitations

1. **Hook Registration**: Can only be set once during initialization
2. **Event Storage**: Events are not stored, only emitted
3. **Hook Performance**: Synchronous execution may impact latency
4. **No Hook Removal**: Once set, hooks cannot be removed

## Next Steps

1. **Stage 13: Governance Integration**
   - Parameter updates via governance
   - Emergency actions
   - Cap adjustments

2. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Async hook execution option
   - Event replay functionality
   - Hook metrics and monitoring
   - Dynamic hook registration

## Metrics

- **Files Created**: 3 (hooks.go, hooks_test.go, events_emission_test.go)
- **Files Modified**: 5 (events.go, events_typed.go, keeper files)
- **New Event Types**: 3 (rate limit exceeded/warning, activity tracked)
- **Hook Methods**: 9 interface methods
- **Test Cases**: 20+ test scenarios
- **Lines of Code**: ~1200 (including tests)

## Architecture Highlights

The events and hooks system follows a clean pattern:

```
Operation Request
      ↓
Pre-Hook Validation → [Pass/Reject]
      ↓
Core Operation
      ↓
State Changes
      ↓
Event Emission
      ↓
Post-Hook Notification
```

This ensures external modules can:
1. Validate operations before execution
2. React to successful operations
3. Monitor all activity via events
4. Build complex cross-module features

## Conclusion

Stage 12 has successfully implemented a comprehensive events and hooks system for the liquid staking module. The implementation provides extensive integration points for external modules while maintaining clean separation of concerns. The rich event system enables detailed monitoring and analytics, while the hooks interface allows for complex cross-module interactions.
