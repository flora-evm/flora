# Stage 14 Completion Report: Exchange Rate Updates

## Overview
Stage 14 has been successfully completed. This stage implemented the dynamic exchange rate system for Liquid Staking Tokens (LST), allowing LST tokens to appreciate in value as staking rewards accumulate.

## Completed Components

### 1. Exchange Rate Types (✓)
- Added `ExchangeRate` type to track per-validator rates
- Added `GlobalExchangeRate` type for future protocol-wide rates
- Added `ExchangeRateUpdate` type for tracking rate changes
- Updated protobuf definitions with new types and messages

### 2. Storage Implementation (✓)
**File**: `x/liquidstaking/keeper/exchange_rate.go`
- Implemented storage and retrieval methods for exchange rates
- Added iteration methods for processing all rates
- Implemented rate calculation logic based on staked tokens and LST supply
- Added automatic initialization of rates to 1:1

### 3. Tokenization Updates (✓)
**File**: `x/liquidstaking/keeper/msg_server.go:96-101`
- Modified `TokenizeShares` to apply exchange rates
- LST tokens minted = Native tokens / Exchange Rate
- Maintains backward compatibility by storing native amounts

### 4. Redemption Updates (✓)
**File**: `x/liquidstaking/keeper/msg_server.go:272-277`
- Modified `RedeemTokens` to apply inverse exchange rates
- Native tokens returned = LST tokens * Exchange Rate
- Properly calculates shares to restore based on native tokens

### 5. Manual Update Message (✓)
**File**: `x/liquidstaking/keeper/msg_server.go:407-482`
- Implemented `MsgUpdateExchangeRates` handler
- Authority-only access control (governance module)
- Supports updating all validators or specific ones
- Returns old and new rates for transparency

### 6. Query Implementation (✓)
**File**: `x/liquidstaking/keeper/grpc_query.go:497-576`
- Added `ExchangeRate` query for single validator rates
- Added `AllExchangeRates` query with pagination support
- Includes LST denom and native amount calculations

### 7. Genesis Handling (✓)
**File**: `x/liquidstaking/keeper/genesis.go`
- Updated `InitGenesis` to import exchange rates
- Updated `ExportGenesis` to export exchange rates
- Auto-initializes rates for validators with LST tokens

### 8. Codec Registration (✓)
**File**: `x/liquidstaking/types/codec.go`
- Registered `MsgUpdateExchangeRates` with codec
- Ensures proper serialization/deserialization

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Storage Format**: Exchange rates stored as decimal values with timestamps
2. **Default Rate**: New validators start with 1:1 exchange rate
3. **Rate Calculation**: Rate = (Total Staked + Rewards) / LST Supply
4. **Authority Control**: Only governance can manually update rates (automated in Stage 15)
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Tokenization records still store native token amounts

## Exchange Rate Formula

```
Exchange Rate = Total Value / LST Supply

Where:
- Total Value = Validator Tokens + Accumulated Rewards
- LST Supply = Total minted LST tokens for validator
```

## Usage Examples

### Query Exchange Rate
```bash
florad query liquidstaking exchange-rate [validator-address]
```

### Update Exchange Rates (Authority Only)
```bash
# Update all validators
florad tx liquidstaking update-exchange-rates --from authority

# Update specific validators
florad tx liquidstaking update-exchange-rates floravaloper1xxx floravaloper2yyy --from authority
```

## Integration Points

1. **Tokenization**: Automatically applies current exchange rate when minting LST
2. **Redemption**: Automatically applies inverse rate when burning LST
3. **Genesis**: Preserves rates across chain restarts
4. **Queries**: Allows external systems to track current rates

## Future Enhancements (Stage 15)

1. **Automated Updates**: Exchange rates will update automatically as rewards accumulate
2. **Auto-Compound**: Rewards will be automatically restaked
3. **Event Emission**: Rate changes will emit events for indexing
4. **Historical Tracking**: Store rate history for analytics

## Testing Requirements

The following test scenarios need to be implemented:
1. Exchange rate initialization and updates
2. Tokenization with different exchange rates
3. Redemption with appreciated rates
4. Genesis import/export with rates
5. Query functionality
6. Authority validation
7. Edge cases (zero supply, no rewards, etc.)

## Migration Notes

No migration required as this is a new feature. Existing tokenization records continue to work as expected with the default 1:1 rate until updated.

## Conclusion

Stage 14 successfully implements the foundation for dynamic LST pricing. The system is now ready for Stage 15, which will add automated rate updates and reward compounding.
