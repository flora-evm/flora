# Liquid Staking Module Deployment Checklist

This checklist ensures a safe and successful deployment of the liquid staking module to production.

## Pre-Deployment Phase

### Code Review & Testing

- [ ] Unit tests achieve >80% code coverage
- [ ] Integration tests pass with mainnet-like parameters
- [ ] Stress tests completed (high transaction volume)
- [ ] Invariant tests pass
- [ ] Simulation tests run for extended periods

### Security Audit
- [ ] External security audit completed
- [ ] All critical/high severity issues resolved
- [ ] Medium severity issues addressed or documented
- [ ] Audit report published
- [ ] Emergency contact procedures established

### Documentation
- [ ] Technical documentation complete
- [ ] User guides published
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] CLI help text reviewed
- [ ] FAQ section prepared

## Testnet Deployment

### Initial Testnet Launch
- [ ] Deploy to internal testnet
- [ ] Verify all module functions work correctly
- [ ] Test governance proposals
- [ ] Test emergency pause/unpause
- [ ] Monitor for 1 week minimum

### Public Testnet
- [ ] Deploy to public testnet
- [ ] Announce to community
- [ ] Run bug bounty program
- [ ] Monitor metrics and logs
- [ ] Address any issues found
- [ ] Run for minimum 2 weeks

### Testnet Validation
- [ ] Verify tokenization flow works correctly
- [ ] Test redemption with various amounts
- [ ] Confirm exchange rates update properly
- [ ] Test rate limiting functionality
- [ ] Verify caps are enforced
- [ ] Test IBC transfers of LST tokens
- [ ] Validate auto-compound (if enabled)

## Mainnet Preparation

### Parameter Configuration
- [ ] Review and finalize all module parameters:
  - [ ] `enabled`: Start with `true` or `false`?
  - [ ] `global_liquid_staking_cap`: Set conservative limit
  - [ ] `validator_liquid_cap`: Set per-validator limit
  - [ ] `min_liquid_stake_amount`: Set minimum stake
  - [ ] `rate_limit_period_hours`: 24 hours recommended
  - [ ] `global_daily_tokenization_percent`: Start conservative
  - [ ] `validator_daily_tokenization_percent`: Start conservative
  - [ ] `global_daily_tokenization_count`: Set reasonable limit
  - [ ] `validator_daily_tokenization_count`: Set reasonable limit
  - [ ] `user_daily_tokenization_count`: Prevent spam
  - [ ] `warning_threshold_percent`: 90% recommended
  - [ ] `auto_compound_enabled`: Start disabled
  - [ ] `auto_compound_frequency_blocks`: If enabled, set frequency
  - [ ] `max_rate_change_per_update`: 1% recommended
  - [ ] `min_blocks_between_updates`: Prevent manipulation

### Governance Proposal
- [ ] Draft upgrade proposal

- [ ] Address all concerns
- [ ] Submit proposal on-chain

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Upgrade binaries prepared

- [ ] Communication channels open
- [ ] Emergency contacts available

### During Upgrade
- [ ] Monitor upgrade progress
- [ ] Verify consensus after upgrade
- [ ] Check module initialization
- [ ] Confirm parameters are set correctly
- [ ] Test basic operations

### Post-Upgrade Validation
- [ ] Module enabled successfully
- [ ] Query endpoints responding
- [ ] Events being emitted
- [ ] No unexpected errors in logs
- [ ] Metrics collecting properly

## Post-Deployment

### First 24 Hours
- [ ] Monitor all metrics closely
- [ ] Check for any anomalies
- [ ] Respond to user issues
- [ ] Document any problems
- [ ] Prepare hotfix if needed

### First Week
