- [ ] Emergency response procedures documented

### Documentation
- [ ] Technical documentation complete
- [ ] User guides written
- [ ] CLI command reference updated
- [ ] API documentation generated
- [ ] Migration guide for validators prepared

## Testnet Deployment

### Phase 1: Internal Testnet
- [ ] Deploy to internal testnet
- [ ] Run through all user flows
- [ ] Test governance proposals
- [ ] Simulate emergency scenarios
- [ ] Load testing with multiple validators
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics

### Phase 2: Public Testnet
- [ ] Announce testnet deployment
- [ ] Provide testnet faucet
- [ ] Community testing period (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Bug bounty program active
- [ ] Collect and address feedback
- [ ] Document any issues found

### Testnet Validation
- [ ] Tokenization flow works correctly
- [ ] Redemption completes successfully
- [ ] Exchange rates update properly
- [ ] Caps and limits enforced
- [ ] IBC transfers functional
- [ ] Governance proposals execute
- [ ] Emergency controls tested

## Mainnet Preparation

### Parameter Configuration
- [ ] Review and finalize module parameters:
  - [ ] Global liquid staking cap (suggested: 25%)
  - [ ] Validator liquid cap (suggested: 50%)
  - [ ] Minimum stake amount
  - [ ] Rate limit parameters
  - [ ] Auto-compound settings (start disabled)
- [ ] Document parameter choices and rationale

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards created
- [ ] Alerting rules configured
- [ ] Log aggregation set up
- [ ] Backup procedures tested
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

### Validator Coordination
- [ ] Validator upgrade guide distributed
- [ ] Upgrade timeline communicated
- [ ] Binary distribution method agreed
- [ ] Emergency contact list updated
- [ ] Coordination channel established

## Mainnet Deployment

### Upgrade Proposal
- [ ] Upgrade handler registered in app
- [ ] Upgrade proposal drafted
- [ ] Community discussion period
- [ ] Proposal submitted on-chain
- [ ] Voting period monitoring
- [ ] 2/3+ voting power achieved

### Upgrade Execution
- [ ] Validators prepared with new binary
- [ ] Upgrade height reached
- [ ] Chain halts as expected
- [ ] Validators restart with new binary
- [ ] Chain resumes successfully
- [ ] Initial smoke tests pass

### Post-Upgrade Verification
- [ ] Module parameters correct
- [ ] Genesis state properly initialized
- [ ] Basic operations functional:
  - [ ] Can tokenize shares
  - [ ] Can redeem tokens
  - [ ] Exchange rates visible
  - [ ] Queries responding
- [ ] No unexpected errors in logs

## Post-Deployment

### Monitoring Period (Day 1-7)
- [ ] 24/7 monitoring active
- [ ] Daily health checks
- [ ] Performance metrics within bounds
- [ ] No critical issues reported
- [ ] Community feedback positive

### Feature Enablement (Week 2-4)
- [ ] Consider enabling auto-compound via governance
- [ ] Adjust caps based on adoption
- [ ] Fine-tune rate limits if needed
- [ ] Address any minor issues

### Long-term Maintenance
- [ ] Regular security reviews
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Feature enhancement planning
- [ ] Community engagement
- [ ] Quarterly parameter reviews

## Emergency Procedures

### If Issues Arise
1. **Minor Issues**: 
   - Document and plan fix for next upgrade
   - Communicate with community

2. **Major Issues**:
   - Activate emergency pause if needed
   - Coordinate with validators
   - Prepare emergency patch

3. **Critical Issues**:
   - Emergency pause via authority
   - Immediate validator coordination
   - Consider chain halt if necessary
   - Execute rollback if required

### Rollback Procedure
1. Validators coordinate to stop chain
2. Restore from pre-upgrade snapshot
3. Start chain with old binary
4. Investigate and fix issues
5. Plan new upgrade attempt

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- Zero critical bugs in first 30 days
- <0.1% transaction failure rate
- Performance within 10% of baseline
- All security measures functional

### Adoption Success
- >10 validators have LST within 30 days
- >1% of staked tokens liquid within 90 days
- Active governance participation
- Positive community sentiment
